Welcomes the user with a welcome message.

This project will scrape the liveabout.com web page and list the top 25 Beatles songs.

When the CLI starts, it will welcome the user and give them a list of the top 25 Beatles songs.

Once the user enters a number from 1 to 25, it will return the corresponding Beatles song and give the user more information about it, which will include its name, year of release, peak billboard ranking, etc.

The user can also return to the original list to select a different song.

Once a user is done, they can exit the CLI and it will output a goodbye message.
