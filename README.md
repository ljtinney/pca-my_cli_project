## Overview

  The app pulls data from https://www.liveabout.com/top-beatles-songs-4058717.

Welcomes the user with a welcome message.

This project will scrape the liveabout.com web page and list the top 25 Beatles songs.

When the CLI starts, it will welcome the user and give them a list of the top 25 Beatles songs.

Once the user enters a number from 1 to 25, it will return the corresponding Beatles song and give the user more information about it, which will include its name, year of release,& peak billboard ranking.

The user can also return to the original list to select a different song or enter `exit` to quit the CLI Program.

Once a user is finished, they can exit the CLI Program and it will output a goodbye message.

## How to run the program

To initiate the CLI, type in `.bin/run.rb`.

To learn more about a song, select the song according to its ranking (number between 1 - 25).

When finished, simply type `exit` to quit the CLI Program.
