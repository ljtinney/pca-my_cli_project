Provide a CLI that exposes data scraped from a web page.

The application must allow the user to learn more based on their input. This will be done by showing the user a list of options, allowing them to choose a specific option, and then showing them more info based on their choice.

After the user enters input, your CLI should reach out to the web page again to scrape additional data. Write your code in such a way that it outputs useful instructions if one submits invalid input.

Use the example domains below for inspiration, but the web page you choose to scrape will guide how your CLI can be built. Check your domain with your instructor before starting your project.

Use Object Oriented design patterns. You should be creating instances of objects that relate to one another. Attempt to make your code as "DRY" (Don't Repeat Yourself) as possible.

The application should conform to Nitro's Ruby linting conventions. The .rubocop.yml file included in this repo must be copied over to your application, it is not exactly the same as the generic file copied over to your system from the Ruby Linting lesson. Running rubocop from your application's root should return a no offenses detected message.
